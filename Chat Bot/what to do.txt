we have in the code

functions to fill string, create string, give random reply to a certain record


our main_focus function is Reply_To_AI(char* name) which takes as an input the name of the user entered by him in the main function

we want to make a loop inside the main_focus function that will infinitely loop until the user will enter some string containing exit

inside the loop we have the first thing to check if the user entered hi then we Reply_To_HI() to the entered value

then we check if the random reply contains assest or not

if the reply contains an assest then start a conservation asking the user to enter a command 



 ////  see the Project_AI commands to know the commands ////



we can make a function that contains all the commands and put it after the hi reply to check all the commands

the function will take as input
